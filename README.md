# Finite Simple Groups

As part of MA376 Abstract Algebra at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, I researched a topic beyond the scope of the course material. I selected to study the classification of finite simple groups. I wrote a paper detailing my findings and how they related to the course and gave a presentation in the last week of class for the benefit of my classmates.
